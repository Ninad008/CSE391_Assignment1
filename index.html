        <h1>My Info</h1>
        <p>
            Hello everyone, my name is Ninad Abdur Rahman.
            I'm an undergraduate student studying at 
            <a href="https://www.bracu.ac.bd/">BRAC University</a> 
            Department of Computer Science.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am learning web developing through one of the courses offered by Brac
            <a href="https://piazza.com/class/kyzuq0kk9r460x">CSE391</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Favorite Quote</h2>
        <img src="img/nebula.jpg" alt="Nebula" class="profile-pic">
        <p>
            "Life is short enjoy every moment!"
        </p>
        <p>
            While there are a lot of great quotes that you can find inspiration from this one is my favorite because it reminds me of some very important things.
            It reminds me that all of us have a limited time and also that we spend most of it without appreciating what we have.
            So while I stress thinking about the unknown future I also remember to enjoy the present as much as possible.
            We are but an insignificant cogwheel in this enormous universe. So let us not fret as we will be where we are meant to be!
            Hope you can now also think a little differently from before!

        <p>
            My father is an artist and so I had grown to love Drawing and Painting from a very early age. While my love for it has not changed it is quite hard to find time and motivation to dedicate to an art piece.

            There are some activities that I love watching on Youtube and would love to have them as hobbies in future. Currently as a student it is just not feasible for me. I would like to introduce you to one such interesting activity, it is called Gunpla Kit modelling.
